  <h1>Architecture Overview</h1>


  <p class="para">
   This section explains how all the different parts of the driver fit
   together. From the different language runtimes, through the extension and
   to the PHP libraries on top. This new architecture has replaced the old
   <code class="code">mongo</code> extension. We refer to the new one
   as the <code class="code">mongodb</code> extension.

  <p class="para">
   At the top of this stack sits a pure
   <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP library</a>, which we will
   distribute as a Composer package. This library will provide an API similar
   to what users have come to expect from the old mongo driver (e.g. CRUD methods,
   database and collection objects, command helpers) and we expect it to be a
   common dependency for most applications built with MongoDB. This library
   will also implement common
   <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/specifications" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;specifications</a>, in the
   interest of improving API consistency across all of the
   <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;drivers</a> maintained by
   MongoDB (and hopefully some community drivers, too).
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   Sitting below that library we have the lower level driver.
   This extension will effectively form the glue between PHP and our
   system libraries (<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;libmongoc</a> and
   <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/libbson" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;libbson</a>). This extension
   will expose an identical public API for the most essential and
   performance-sensitive functionality:

   <ul class="simplelist">
    <li class="member">Connection management</li>
    <li class="member">BSON encoding and decoding</li>
    <li class="member">Object document serialization (to support ODM libraries)</li>
    <li class="member">Executing commands and write operations</li>
    <li class="member">Handling queries and cursors</li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   By decoupling the driver internals and a high-level API into an extension and
   PHP libraries, respectively, we hope to reduce our maintainence burden and
   allow for faster iteration on new features. As a welcome side effect, this
   also makes it easier for anyone to contribute to the driver. Additionally,
   an identical public API will make it that much easier to port an
   application across PHP runtimes, whether the application uses the low-level
   driver directly or a higher-level PHP library.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;GridFS</a> is a great example
   of why we chose this direction.
   Although we implemented GridFS in C for our old mongo driver, it is actually
   quite a high-level specification. Its API is just an abstraction for
   accessing two collections: files (i.e. metadata) and chunks (i.e. blocks of
   data). Likewise, all of the syntactic sugar found in the old mongo driver,
   such as processing uploaded files or exposing GridFS files as PHP streams,
   can be implemented in pure PHP. Provided we have performant methods for
   reading from and writing to GridFS&#039; collections – and thanks to our low
   level extensions, we will – shifting this API to PHP is win-win.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Earlier I mentioned that we expect the PHP library to be a common
   dependency for <em class="emphasis">most</em> applications, but not
   <em class="emphasis">all</em>. Some users may prefer to stick to the no-frills
   API offered by the extensions, or create their own high-level abstraction
   (akin to <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;Doctrine MongoDB</a> for
   the old mongo driver). Future libraries could include a PHP library geared
   for MongoDB administration, which provides an API for various user
   management and ops commands. The next major version of
   <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;Doctrine MongoDB ODM</a> will
   likely also sit directly atop the extensions.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   While we will continue to maintain and support the old mongo driver and its
   users for the foreseeable future, we invite everyone to use the
   next-generation driver and consider it for any new projects going forward.
   You can find all of the essential components across GitHub and JIRA:

   The existing <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP</a> project in JIRA
   will remain open for reporting bugs against the old mongo driver, but we
   would ask that you use the new projects above for anything pertaining to
   our next-generation drivers.
